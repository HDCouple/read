# ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
When the definitive “History of the Thank-You Note Through the Ages” is compiled, this whole book could well be an exhibit. It is the third we have done together on various aspects of the great transformation to the Information Age now under way. The Sovereign Individual builds upon research and analysis that went into Blood in the Streets and The Great Reckoning. Like those books, it appropriates the thoughts of many authorities whose work is credited in the texts and citations. It also builds upon insights gained in conversations, both recently and over the past decade. In that sense, we should probably repeat all of our acknowledgments to the friends and accomplices who helped us in crucial ways in our two previous books. For the record, we do. Those whom we have mentioned and overlooked in our previous books, please take note. You have our thanks, cubed, for a decade of stimulation and kindnesses. Our special thanks go to Bill Bonner, who has helped us stay abreast of the changing currents of publishing during the past decade. It is mainly his genius that accounts for the huge worldwide circulation of our newsletter, Strategic Investment. He has helped us formulate ongoing market tests of our ideas. But more to the point, he has been an indispensable friend and sounding board.

We also acknowledge the special friendship of Alan Lindsay; Brian, Donald, and Scott Lines; Robert Lloyd George; Jane Collis; Carter Beese; Andy Miller; Scott Hill; Nils Taube; Gilbert de Botton; Michael Geltner; Mark Ford; David Keating; Pete Sepp; Curtin Winsor, III; V. Harwood Bocker, III; Guillermo Cervino; Eduardo Maschwitz; Michael Reynal; Jorge Gamarci; Jackie Locke; Douglas Reid; Jose Pascar; Luis Kenny; Robert Lawrence, III; Ken Klein; Kim Saull; Jim Moloney; Mike Geltner; Lee Euler; Tom Crema; Nancy Lazar; Greg Barnhill; Becky Mangus; Nancy Oppenlander; Wayne Livingstone; Hans Kuppers; Michael Baybak; Allan Zschlag; David Hale; Lisa Eden; Mel Lieberman; Glenn Blaugh; Sir Roger Douglas; Michael Smorch; Jimmie Rogers; Ambrose Evans-Pritchard; Chris Wood; Marc Faber; Ronnie Chan; William F. Nicklin; Lenny Smith; Jack Wheeler; Jim Bennett; Gordon Tullock; Jay Bernstein; Gary Vernier; Jenny Mitchel; Julia Guth; Lisa Young; Mia; Mark Frasier; Lisa Bernard; Rita Smith; Ruth Lyons; Yarah Chiekh; Fabian Dilaimy; Tim Hoese; and our families.

As before, we apologize to those whom we have overlooked. We are sorry that the acknowledgment we owe them has fallen between the cracks, like an unpaid bill that got tangled up with the grocery circulars and tossed away. Perhaps we can avoid the wrath of the collection agency by posting a bond of thanks to all our unmentioned friends. We depend on you even more than we realize.

Finally, we thank those who were specifically involved in launching this project: our agent, Theron Raines; our editor, Dominick Anfuso; and the other good people at Simon & Schuster, including Carolyn Reidy, Cassie Jones, Ana DeBevoise, and Cherise Grant.

# PREFACE
Medieval men despaired of the will. They thought of humans as wounded and weak. But they respected the intellect. They thought even humans, if we think carefully, have the power to answer the most profound questions of God and the Universe.

Modern men worship the will, but they despair of the intellect. The wisdom of crowds; the swerve of random particles; the influence of unconscious biases: all of these contemporary clichés are ways to talk about intellectual weakness—or ways to talk ourselves into it.

Lord William Rees-Mogg and James Dale Davidson do not promise answers about God and the Universe, nor do they supply any. But their investigation of “megapolitics”—an anatomy of the forces at work in history and a set of predictions for the near future—is unusual, or even countercultural, because it applies human reason to matters that we have been taught to leave to chance or fate.

Looking back almost a quarter century after the first publication of The Sovereign Individual, the easiest thing to do, and the thing most encouraged by the culture around us, is to look at what they got wrong—almost as if to reassure ourselves that there was no point all along in thinking carefully about the future.

And of course, there are some things they missed: above all, the rise of China. The twenty-first-century People’s Republic of China under the Communist Party has created its very own version of the Information Age with decidedly nationalist, ethnically homogenous, profoundly statist characteristics. This is probably the single biggest “megapolitical” development since the book came out. To cite just one key illustration, Communist China has crushed the city-state of Hong Kong—whereas Rees-Mogg and Davidson had described Hong Kong as “a mental model of the kind of jurisdiction that we expect to see flourish in the Information Age.”

On one account, this is a blind spot on the part of the authors. On another view, it can seem like China’s Politburo must have been keen readers of The Sovereign Individual. It is only through a unique long-term awareness that looks back to Lenin and Stalin as well as forward to the Information Age that the Party’s leaders prevailed amid the trends analyzed by this book.

Those trends—winner-take-all economics, jurisdictional competition, the shift away from mass production, and the arguable obsolescence of interstate warfare—are still at work today. The rise of China is less a refutation of Rees-Mogg and Davidson than a dramatic raising of the stakes they described.

In truth, the great conflict over our megapolitical future is only just beginning. On the dimension of technology, the conflict has two poles: AI and crypto. Artificial Intelligence holds out the prospect of finally solving what economists call the “calculation problem”: AI could theoretically make it possible to centrally control an entire economy. It is no coincidence that AI is the favorite technology of the Communist Party of China. Strong cryptography, at the other pole, holds out the prospect of a decentralized and individualized world. If AI is communist, crypto is libertarian.

The future may lie somewhere between these two extreme poles. But we know the actions we take today will determine the overall outcome. Reading The Sovereign Individual in 2020 is a way to think carefully about the future that your own actions will help to create. It is an opportunity not to be wasted.
